# 🚆 Train Booking System (C++ | Object-Oriented Programming)

**Problem Statement:**  
Railway ticket booking is traditionally handled through manual or semi-automated systems that can lead to inefficiencies such as incorrect seat tracking, delays in booking and cancellation, and difficulty in managing passenger information. For students learning programming, there is also a need to understand how real-world problems can be translated into software solutions using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The problem addressed in this project is to design and implement a simple yet effective train booking system that automates ticket booking, ticket cancellation, and seat availability tracking using C++, while clearly demonstrating the application of OOPS principles.

**Description:**  
The Train Booking System is a console-based application developed in C++ that simulates the core functionalities of a basic railway reservation system. The system provides a menu-driven interface through which users can interact with the application. Users can view a list of available trains along with their train numbers, routes, and the number of seats currently available. When a user chooses to book a ticket, the system collects passenger details such as name and age, checks seat availability for the selected train, and generates a unique ticket ID upon successful booking. The application also allows users to cancel an existing ticket using the ticket ID, after which the seat availability is automatically updated. The system ensures that seat counts remain consistent and accurate throughout all operations. This project is designed to be simple, readable, and suitable for academic purposes, making it ideal for beginners who are learning C++ and Object-Oriented Programming.

**Solution:**  
The solution is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure modularity, clarity, and ease of maintenance. The system is divided into multiple classes, each responsible for a specific task. Encapsulation is used to bind data members and related functions within classes such as Train, Passenger, Ticket, and TrainBookingSystem. Inheritance is applied by creating a base class Person that stores common attributes like name and age, which is then extended by the Passenger class to promote code reusability. Abstraction is achieved through a menu-driven interface that hides the internal working of the system from the user and exposes only necessary operations such as booking and cancellation. Composition is used where the Ticket class contains objects of Passenger and references to Train, representing a real-world booking relationship. The entire system is implemented using standard C++ and STL containers like vectors to efficiently manage trains and tickets. This structured approach results in a clean, maintainable, and scalable console-based train booking system.
